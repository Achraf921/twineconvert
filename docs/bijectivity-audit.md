# Bijectivity Audit

Generated 2026-05-11 from src/lib/engine/converters/.

## Summary

| Classification | Count |
|---|---:|
| Total converters | 295 |
| **Bijective candidates** (lossless, same-kind, both directions exist) | 146 |
| **Bijective candidates missing reverse converter** | 8 |
| **Bijective candidates missing round-trip test** | 20 |
| Lossy encoding (same kind, but lossy format) | 58 |
| Cross-kind (raster→doc, video→audio, etc., inherently lossy) | 32 |
| Single-action (no reverse possible) | 51 |
| Unknown formats (need to add to FORMATS table) | 0 |
| Compound id (irregular pattern) | 0 |

## Action Items

### 2. Bijective converters MISSING their reverse pair

These converters are lossless and could round-trip, but the reverse converter isn't implemented. Adding the reverse unlocks bijectivity testing AND another tool page for SEO.

| Forward | Missing reverse |
|---|---|
| `adif-to-kml` | `kml-to-adif` |
| `eml-to-csv` | `csv-to-eml` |
| `hl7-to-csv` | `csv-to-hl7` |
| `json-to-sql` | `sql-to-json` |
| `json5-to-json` | `json-to-json5` |
| `opt-to-csv` | `csv-to-opt` |
| `otf-to-ttf` | `ttf-to-otf` |
| `tiff-to-png` | `png-to-tiff` |

### 3. Bijective pairs MISSING a round-trip test

Both directions exist and are theoretically lossless, but no round-trip test verifies it. These are the highest-leverage tests to add (they catch bugs in EITHER direction).

| Pair | A→B | B→A |
|---|---|---|
| bmp ↔ png | `bmp-to-png` | `png-to-bmp` |
| dst ↔ exp | `dst-to-exp` | `exp-to-dst` |
| dst ↔ jef | `dst-to-jef` | `jef-to-dst` |
| dst ↔ pes | `dst-to-pes` | `pes-to-dst` |
| exp ↔ jef | `exp-to-jef` | `jef-to-exp` |
| exp ↔ pes | `exp-to-pes` | `pes-to-exp` |
| gif ↔ png | `gif-to-png` | `png-to-gif` |
| ico ↔ png | `ico-to-png` | `png-to-ico` |
| jef ↔ pes | `jef-to-pes` | `pes-to-jef` |
| ttf ↔ woff | `ttf-to-woff` | `woff-to-ttf` |
